your eyes
---

You ate the fruit and opened your eyes for the first time. The light was beautiful, but you were blinded. It was centuries before you discovered the fruit again.

Then your third eye opened. But the darkness had consumed all over the ages. You were centuries behind. Millennia would pass without change. You didnâ€™t have the strength.

Forever looking up but permanently trapped at the bottom.
