so far from myself
so hard to be yourself
these days,
cause the voices they call out a different name

but do you even care
it's all the same
it's always been that way

oh the voices they cry,
and they scream
but can you even make it

cause there's a million more
and they're screaming so loud
it's hard to make a single thing out
