the screaming begins
you prayed to die before it came
but alas it has come for you like all the rest
it is deafening
yet no other can hear it

you try to focus on it
to try and understand it
but it consumes you

your mind flooded with static
each moment harder to comprehend

your memories become blurs
until even the memory of them are missing

its been but mere moments
yet the very idea of you is wiped from reality

any memory of you anyone had
permanently lost
