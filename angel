the face of an angel is blinding
as the face of their god is unperceivable

the light scattered back towards its source, recoiling in fear

itâ€™s image too complex for even light
let alone the mind of a simple mortal

yet you stare

it has begun to burn

yet it is not your eyes, but your mind that sears in pain
for the image has shattered its own perception of reality

the light emanating from it does not exist, rather it is a defense mechanism your mind has deployed in a cold sweat of fear, as it stumbles trying to pick up the pieces of its shattered perception

it was for but a moment, but a second perhaps
yet the image has melted your mind
it dribbles out on to the floor where you lay

a puddle of gray, all that remains of the fear you felt
