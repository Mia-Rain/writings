baby, I feel like I've had enough
cause everyday, I'm a little worse for wear
swear this shit a'int fair
need to get some air (it just a'int fair)

feel like I've had enough of it
cause everyday there's little bit more of it
and I just can't take it
cause I'm runnin' outta shit to give

so baby lay me down
and turn the lights out

cause this is the last of it
just can't take this shit
