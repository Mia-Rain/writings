recently it’s been hurting so much
same shit on replay again
ones i lost back again
and my sanity can’t handle this
honestly it hurts so bad
to have to hurt to sing these thoughts
they say "break my heart to make me a star"
but honestly i don’t want that
wish things were easier

hope you’ll see my point of view
but in the end it’s all the same
no control as always
that’s just that
