each day is a little longer
each moment a little smaller

some days so exciting
yet the come down is everlasting after

even our medication is harder
like our hands are fighting ever longer

as if none of it can even matter
—
yet this loop is on repeat
it won’t seem to let me free
again and again
each day another dream

tell me please

what’s next around this corner

will it heal me
or make it so much harder
—
these addictions are gripping me

struggling each morning

searching for the answers to all the questions i’ve been finding

yet a relapse heals it all
why must i always fall
these bosses too tall
crushed beneath, unless thy stall
