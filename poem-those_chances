to know that if they had only helped for a moment
to know that if they had given us the chance
to know that weâ€™re trapped despite it all

we deserved those chances
and they were kept from us

and so we will never be free

unable to see past it
forever
trapped

we wish we had stayed in our headspace
the safety from it all
yet now this body consumes us

never to be free again
